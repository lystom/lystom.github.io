## Abstract

This work aims to investigate whether body waves emitted by strong oceanic storms can be extracted from seismic noise records and used for tomographic studies. We computed cross-correlations between pair of stations during a "weather bomb" event in the Northern Atlantic that occurred from the 8th to the 10th of December 2014. P-waves that travelled in the mantle are observed at teleseismic distances on the correlations. Our long-term goal is to use the travel time of such body waves to image the Deep Earth. To that end, we assess the impact of the spatiotemporal evolution of the source (location, spatial extent, strength, frequency content) on the cross-correlations body waves. We compute synthetic correlations using the WAVEWATCHIII hindcast model and precomputed AxiSEM Green's functions. The comparison of synthetic and observed correlations shows that the effect of the spatiotemporal evolution of the source on the P-wave arrival time can be quantified. This could allow using such measurements to image the mantle without bias from the source's complexity.
