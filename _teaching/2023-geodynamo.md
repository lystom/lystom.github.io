During two consecutive years, I gave courses solving problems in fluid dynamics applied to the global Earth. This course used dimensional analysis to solve complex problems related to fluid dynamics applied to geophysics. Below is a list of the problems subjects:

- Isostatic Rebound
- Dimensional Analysis
- Coriolis
- Mantle Convection
- Core Dynamics
- Core Formation
