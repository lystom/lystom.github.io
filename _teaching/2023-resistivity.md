In spring 2023, I helped to teach practical work for bachelor students in electromagnetic methods
applied to geophysics.

This course contained two different workshops to determine the depth of the water table on Grenoble University's campus, resistivity profile to build a 2D resistivity depth profile tomography and the use of electro-magnetic to retrieve a 2D maps
of the conductivity on campus.
