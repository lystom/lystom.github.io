## Abstract
Body wave extraction from oceanic secondary microseismic sources with seismic interferometry provides alternative information to better constrain the Earth's structure. However, sources' spatiotemporal variations raise concerns about travel time measurement robustness. Therefore, we study the cross‐correlations’ stability during a single oceanic event. This study focuses on 3 days of data and three seismic arrays' combinations between 8 and 11 December 2014 during storm Alexandra, a “weather bomb” event in southern Greenland. We use the WAVEWATCH III hindcast to model P‐wave noise sources and assess the impact of short‐term source variations on cross‐correlations. Model‐based cross‐correlations compared to data show coherent delays to reference 3D Earth models (∼0–3 s) confirming the robustness of the source model which could explain minor travel time variations (≤1 s).
