## Abstract

We investigate the modeling of P-wave reflections on the mantle transition zone (MTZ) discontinuities (Pv410p* and Pv660p*) using ambient seismic noise generated by distant oceanic sources. Using ray theory and waveform simulations, we assess biases in arrival times and amplitude ratios when interpreting noise correlations as Green‘s functions. Our results show that source distribution and the b-caustic effect strongly influence signal recovery. Simulations based on realistic oceanic models (WAVEWATCH III) demonstrate that appropriate source conditions significantly reduce biases. This approach enables reliable imaging of the MTZ, particularly in regions like the greater Alpine area with favorable microseismic source distribution.
